# iitar = 1         ! target state are orthogonal but not diagonalize the atomic Hamiltonian  !!!
# itype = -1        ! bound calculations, this flag should be putted on dbsr_mat stage !!!

dbsr_mat3a  klsp1=1  klsp2=9   itype=-1  iitar=1
         

# at the moment, no preferences for dbsr_mata and dbsr_matb,
# but they differ by using memory and some logic steps of calculations
