This is an example for using the DBSR complex for bound-states calculations for the Rb states

We consider the 4p6/nl Rydberg series as multi-channel expansion    e + Rb^+  :

  4p6/nl  +  4p5/{5s,5p,4d}/n'l'    (overal 27 target [core]  state)

where the first term represent the state under consideration and others - correlation states 
which are supposed to represent the core-valence correlation

==============================================================
1 step  -  generation of target (core) states with DBSR_HF

these calculations are given  in the 4p6 and 4p5_nl folders 
and recorded in to batch (.bat) files

==============================================================
2 step  -  the main DBSR calculation, folder dbsr_cc027

We fitst collect the target state and when run standard DBSR calculations given in the script files

Final results can be considered the "bound_tab" file with the list of obtained states
and "zf_res" file with oscillator strengths from the ground state

==============================================================
We also may extract the Rb states as pairs of c- and bsw- files
(see the script run_07_bound_bsw.bat)
which will be used in the Rb-scattering example

==============================================================
This is computationally rather intensive calculations,
most likely, the memory on th standard PC could be not enough

It is why I simplify the target expansions (see target_jj_0 as original full
case which should be used into actual calculations)

I also remove some big intermediate file to save the memory
